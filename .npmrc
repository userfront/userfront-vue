; As of v8.14.0, npm chokes on peerDependencies when installing multiple versions
; of a package alongside one another. In our case, we have multiple Vue 
; and @vue/test-utils versions as devDependencies. With default strict peer dependencies, npm
; doesn't know that we want @vue/test-utils-3's peer dependency to be fulfilled by vue-3.
; Opportunity for improvement: this could theoretically be fixed with a combination
; of overrides in package-lock.json, but I wasn't able to find the right combination.
